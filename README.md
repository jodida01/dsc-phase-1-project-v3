# Aircraft Risk Evaluation for Business Expansion

# Overview

This project analyzes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 to help a company planning to expand into the aviation sector. By cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the data, I provide actionable insights for selecting the safest aircraft models for purchase.

# Business Understanding

The company is expanding into new industries and considering purchasing aircraft for commercial and private use. However, they lack information about the risks associated with different aircraft types.

## Stakeholder:

    Head of the new aviation division.

## Key Business Questions:

    Which types of aircraft have the lowest accident rates?

    What are the most common causes of aviation accidents?

    How can the company minimize risk when selecting aircraft for their fleet?

# Data Understanding and Analysis

## Source of Data:

    Kaggle - Aviation Accident Database Synopses

## Description of Data:

    The dataset includes civil aviation accidents and incidents from 1962 to 2023.

    It contains fields such as event date, location, aircraft model, flight purpose, accident narrative, injury severity, and probable cause.

## Three Visualizations:

   ### Accidents by Aircraft Type:

        A bar chart displaying the number of accidents associated with different aircraft models, helping to identify safer models.

   ### Accidents by Cause:

        A pie chart breaking down the primary causes of accidents (e.g., pilot error, mechanical failure, weather), showing major risk factors.

   ### Accidents Over Time:

        A line graph showing accident trends over the decades, highlighting improvements in aviation safety and helping contextualize modern risks.

# Conclusion

## Summary of Conclusions:

    Aircraft models with fewer accidents (such as [insert specific model if available]) should be prioritized for purchase to minimize operational risk.

    Pilot error and mechanical failure were identified as the leading causes of aviation accidents, suggesting that investments in pilot training and rigorous maintenance programs are crucial.

    Accident rates have decreased significantly over the past few decades, indicating that newer aircraft models and modern safety regulations have improved aviation safety.

These insights will assist the head of the aviation division in making informed, data-driven decisions about aircraft procurement and safetyÂ strategy.
